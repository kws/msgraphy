# Yet another Graph API Implementation

Why? Oh why? Why did I not call this YAGAI? Anyway, why do we need another implementation?

We probably don't. But the existing implementations I could find did not have the features I needed,
and/or were not easy enough to extend. 

Here are a few very basic components that will help you compose the features you need (hopefully). 

Lots of features missing though. YMMV.
